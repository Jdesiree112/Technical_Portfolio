# Transitioning from Simple Time Metrics to Comprehensive ML Evaluation Infrastructure

## Project Evolution and Rationale

The Mimir educational AI chatbot has evolved from a functional prototype to a production system. This transition requires replacing the original time-based metrics system with comprehensive ML evaluation infrastructure.

### Original System: Purpose and Limitations

The time-based metrics system tracked processing times across functions (LLM invocation, prompt selection, graph generation, LangGraph orchestration) to identify performance bottlenecks during initial development. This approach worked for debugging latency issues and ensuring basic functionality.

However, time metrics cannot address current development priorities:

- Prompt engineering effectiveness
- ML classifier decision quality
- Educational impact of generated responses
- Conversation data patterns indicating successful learning
- Systematic model improvement based on user feedback

### New Infrastructure Requirements

The project now focuses on model quality, educational effectiveness, and continuous improvement rather than basic functionality. This requires evaluation frameworks that assess accuracy, learning outcomes, and user experience.

### Selected Tools and Benefits

**Hugging Face LightEval** replaces the deprecated Evaluate library with an actively maintained framework supporting 7,000+ evaluation tasks across knowledge, math, coding, and multilingual domains. Key features:

- Sample-by-sample debugging capabilities
- Custom education-specific metric creation
- Multiple deployment backends (local, distributed, endpoint-based)
- Systematic evaluation across relevant educational benchmarks

**Hugging Face Trackio** provides experiment tracking with practical advantages over commercial alternatives:

- API compatibility with existing wandb workflows (drop-in replacement)
- Local-first design with optional cloud hosting
- Free hosting and data accessibility (no vendor lock-in)
- Embeddable dashboards for collaboration
- Native integration with Transformers and Accelerate
- Lightweight codebase (<3,000 lines) for easy customization

**Hugging Face Accelerate** handles computational scaling for complex evaluation workflows, batch processing of conversation data, and distributed training experiments.

### Implementation Rationale

This infrastructure directly supports Mimir's educational mission by enabling measurement of tutoring effectiveness, concept explanation quality, and learning progression indicators. The system's data accessibility and visualization capabilities provide insights needed for iterative improvement of educational AI systems.

The transition from debugging-focused metrics to comprehensive evaluation infrastructure reflects the project's maturation from "does it work" to "how well does it work."
