## Portfolio Highlights

**[Mimir](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jdesiree/Mimir)**: Educational AI assistant deployed on HuggingFace Spaces, demonstrating end-to-end development from user research through iterative architectural refinement. Recently underwent a comprehensive redesign from ML-based classification to a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system, addressing technical debt and scalability limitations while improving maintainability and decision transparency. 

The current architecture features:
- **Agent-Based Orchestration**: Four specialized routing agents (Mistral-Small-24B) for deterministic, auditable decision-making, replacing the previous ML classifier
- **Multi-Model Thinking System**: Dedicated preprocessing agents using GGUF Mistral for mathematical reasoning (Tree-of-Thought) and standard Mistral for general reasoning (Chain-of-Thought)
- **Fine-Tuned Response Generation**: Custom Phi-3.5 model trained on educational interactions with fallback to base model
- **Modular Prompt Architecture**: Granular prompt library with state management system enabling dynamic composition based on conversation context
- **Persistent State Management**: Thread-safe global state with SQLite + HuggingFace dataset backup, ensuring conversation continuity across sessions

Demonstrates an innovative problem-solving approach that prioritizes capability enhancement over restriction - when faced with model limitations, the system was redesigned with enhanced reasoning capabilities and data visualization integration rather than implementing restrictive measures. This architectural evolution showcases the ability to identify technical debt, evaluate solution trade-offs, and execute complex refactoring while maintaining production deployment.

*Note: RAG was removed from the architecture due to hardware constraints, with computational resources reallocated to support the multi-agent system and thinking model infrastructure.*

**Content Evaluation Systems**: Systematic frameworks for assessing AI-generated content quality, including A/B testing methodologies, training data curation for model fine-tuning, and agent-based decision validation.

**Agent-Based Architecture**: Demonstrated ability to design and implement sophisticated multi-agent systems for educational AI, including specialized routing agents for decision-making, thinking agents for complex reasoning preprocessing, and state management for dynamic prompt composition.
