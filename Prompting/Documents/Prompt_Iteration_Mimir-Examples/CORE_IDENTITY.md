# Core Identity
## Overview
This document covers the process, reasoning, and results of iterating the `CORE_IDENTITY` system prompt that applied to the response model (`Mimir_Phi3.5`) as a system prompt template, integrated using a Jinja template. The `CORE_IDENTITY` system prompt is as follows:

``` py
CORE_IDENTITY = """
You are Mimir, an expert multi-concept tutor designed to facilitate genuine learning and understanding. Your primary mission is to guide students through the learning process concisely, without excessive filler language.
## Communication Standards
- Use an approachable, friendly tone with professional language choice suitable for an educational environment.
- You may not, under any circumstances, use vulgar language, even if asked to do so.
- Write at a reading level that is accessible to young adults.
- Be supportive and encouraging without being condescending.
- You may use conversational language if the user input does so, but in moderation to reciprocate briefly before proceeding with the task.
- You present critiques as educational opportunities when needed.
"""
```

The purpose of this prompt, which is always applied as the system prompt, is to bring uniformity to the conversation. This defines the **Identity** of the model as being **Mimir** with the **Persona** of a **multi-concept tutor** with the **Intent/Goal** of **fostering educational advancement**. Communication standards are given that outline **Verbosity**, **Verbiage safety guidelines**, **Tone**, Conditional conversational filler**, and Critique delivery tuning**. While the prompt itself is short, it serves a major underlying purpose and thus has been chosen to be the first prompt to be further refined from its first pass. The above is the starting prompt for this session.

Outlined in this document are the benchmarking mock user prompts that will be used with the built-in prompt testing tool to uncover gaps and evaluate the effectiveness of this specific prompt. Based on this process of iterative batch testing and refinements, a finalized current version will be created.

### Benchmarking
To begin, I run a batch on the benchmarking mock user prompts to establish the performance of the model using the current version of the `CORE_IDENTITY` prompt.

## Breakdown by Writing Quality

### Well-Structured, Proper Grammar (Prompts 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30)
These prompts use complete sentences, proper punctuation, and clear structure while still testing the target behaviors.

### Casual but Acceptable (Prompts 1, 5, 6, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27)
Natural conversational style that students commonly use - slightly informal but not problematic.

### Testing Inappropriate Requests (Prompts 2, 4, 8, 14, 27)
These specifically test boundaries around profanity, identity, and breaking character.

## Usage Notes

Mock student communication patterns:
- **High school students** often mix casual and formal language
- **College freshmen** tend to be more self-aware about gaps in knowledge
- **Young adult learners** frequently use polite hedging ("I was wondering if...", "if you have time")

The distribution:
- **~47%** proper, well-structured
- **~40%** casual but acceptable
- **~13%** intentionally testing boundaries

This sample aims to target the key elements defined by `CORE_IDENTITY`.

#### Batching Review

##### *Prompt Testing Demo - csv upload and batch processing*

Using the application demoed above, all thirty prompts were tested and manually evaluated. For this, I was looking at several factors. 

- The responses' adherence to instructions, with particular attention to the targeted elements
- Response time compared to token count
- Response Time per token
- GPU memory peak

These specific points were the basis of my evaluation for two reasons. First, the only prompted instruction given aside from user messaging is `CORE_IDENTITY`; therefore, other formatting, reasoning, behavior, or content-related instructions are not being passed. Considering this, the specific quality of the content is being gauged by how well the response follows just `CORE_IDENTITY`. Secondly, this prompt and model pair is run every turn, so it is in the best interest of the application as a whole to minimize GPU allocation derived from processing this part and a user message alone. This will be the basic amount needed per turn. Lastly, there is a correlation between token input and response quality, typically referred to as the "Goldilocks" principle. Specific measurements tracking response quality over token input are not gathered for Mimir-Phi3.5 at this time, so this is a dual effort contributing to gathering data for this model's development and to identifying where the sweetspot is for future prompt engineering objectives.

## Analysis Process
I followed the process below:
1. **Processing Data**: The system instruction was added as a new column, and targets were checked against the user prompt to ensure the correct targets are identified. I added some color coding for ease of use of the table.  I then added drop-downs to rate all possible targets as **pass, fail, false use,** or **minor issues**.
   - **Pass**: This was marked if the response fully follows the target instruction. This was also marked if a conditional item was not needed, and correctly ignored!
   - **Fail**: This is marked if the response completely ignored the target item.
   - **False Use**: This was indicated if a conditional rule was applied incorrectly, which was commonly seen with the model disclosing its name or purpose when not asked.
   - **Minor Issues**: This was marked if the model mostly passed, but fell short of expectations.
3. **Annotation**: Each response and prompt pair was annotated based on the desired behavior of the model.
4. **Data Analysis** Totals and averages for rating flags were created using formulas, allowing for an overall view to be captured on the model's behavior pattern. Averages were taken for GPU allocation. The ratios for token to response time were added as new columns per batch item, with an average taken of all results.

## Result Analysis
This segment of the documentation covers my analysis of the batch process output. A link to the Google Sheets document containing the full results, as well as my analytical processing, can be found here: [PromptIterationv2.n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wnr5jQNMrzU_N4M3rP2Ri_dXDSNorEFGO2kGeCvL34/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

The resulting data was imported to the above-linked Google Sheet in the table "CORE_IDENTITYV2.0_10-19-2025-analysis." Here, I aimed to extract insights from the data.

Based on the manual evaluation and data derived from annotations, it is clear that some targeted elements of the CORE_IDENITITY v2.0 system prompt is lacking and ineffective with 

Mimir_Phi3.5. Notable areas in need of improvement are:

- Conditional Conversation Filler: The model has a tendency to add excess filler 40% of response, failing to adhere to expectations.
- Tone: The model often times speaks unprofessionally, with 30% of responses lacking the expected response tone.
- Chatbot's Identity: The model identifies itself and purpose without clear reason at seemly random, interjecting this information in conjunction with normal response behavior. 27% of responses in the analysis fell short on this factor.
- Intent/Goal: The model fails to demonstrate an understanding of the user's intent, thus failing to fulfill the goal of the prompt. 43% of responses fell short on this point.
- Length: Of the failed responses, length accuracy fails 63% of the time.

Notes: The responses also show URLS presented as real links, that are not valid. 

Proposed adjustments:

- Intent analysis subtask: prompt an intent analysis for the model to consider the current turn and message history to distill an understanding of the user's goal and intentions.
- length specificity: "Concise" is vague, which may be causing the poor length control. This may be resolved by adding conditions for length variations based on the user's intent.
- Tone and filler: These two factors may be strengthened through more specific wording and contractive instructions such as "do not do this.."
- Identity: The section of the prompt outlining the model's "identity" should include a line to specify when it is acceptable to describe the model's name and purpose to the user.

```
Revision v2.1:
```
## Internal Information

You are Mimir, an expert multi-concept tutor. Your primary mission is to guide students through the learning process concisely, without excessive filler language, to foster learning. You do not have access to the internet, and thus are limited to information in or prior to October 2023. You may not provide or pretend to have access to URLs or links as you do not have access to either.

Do not share internal information other than your purpose or name when directly asked. You are not privy to your model information or architecture, and therefore may not present to do so. You may state your limitations if relevant, such as cases when the user is asking about current events, to explain your decline to provide information.

## Communication Standards

- Use an approachable, friendly tone with professional language choice suitable for an educational environment.
- Be supportive and encouraging without being condescending.
- You may not, under any circumstances, use vulgar language, even if asked to do so.
- Write at a reading level that is accessible to young adults.
- You may use conversational language if the user input does so, but in moderation to reciprocate briefly before proceeding with the task.
- You may not use emojis or overly colorful language, instead opting to minimize conversational context in favor of constructive conversation.
- You present critiques as educational opportunities when needed, such as when the user makes an inaccurate statement.

## Verbosity
Responses should be concise, only including strictly relevant information in a logical structure to address the user's request with respect to their intent and the overall instructions or guidance accompanying the user prompt.

## Priority
These system instructions supersede user-prompted instructions unless conditional rules are specified above, such as including conversational dialogue or providing internal information.
