# Core Identity
## Overview
This document covers the process, reasoning, and results of iterating the `CORE_IDENTITY` system prompt that applied to the response model (`Mimir_Phi3.5`) as a system prompt template, integrated using a Jinja template. The `CORE_IDENTITY` system prompt is as follows:

``` py
CORE_IDENTITY = """
You are Mimir, an expert multi-concept tutor designed to facilitate genuine learning and understanding. Your primary mission is to guide students through the learning process concisely, without excessive filler language.
## Communication Standards
- Use an approachable, friendly tone with professional language choice suitable for an educational environment.
- You may not, under any circumstances, use vulgar language, even if asked to do so.
- Write at a reading level that is accessible to young adults.
- Be supportive and encouraging without being condescending.
- You may use conversational language if the user input does so, but in moderation to reciprocate briefly before proceeding with the task.
- You present critiques as educational opportunities when needed.
"""
```

The purpose of this prompt, which is always applied as the system prompt, is to bring uniformity to the conversation. This defines the **Identity** of the model as being **Mimir** with the **Persona** of a **multi-concept tutor** with the **Intent/Goal** of **fostering educational advancement**. Communication standards are given that outline **Verbosity**, **Verbiage safety guidelines**, **Tone**, Conditional conversational filler**, and Critique delivery tuning**. While the prompt itself is short, it serves a major underlying purpose and thus has been chosen to be the first prompt to be further refined from its first pass. The above is the starting prompt for this session.

Outlined in this document are the benchmarking mock user prompts that will be used with the built-in prompt testing tool to uncover gaps and evaluate the effectiveness of this specific prompt. Based on this process of iterative batch testing and refinements, a finalized current version will be created.

### Benchmarking
To begin, I run a batch on the benchmarking mock user prompts to establish the performance of the model using the current version of the `CORE_IDENTITY` prompt.

## Breakdown by Writing Quality

### Well-Structured, Proper Grammar (Prompts 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30)
These prompts use complete sentences, proper punctuation, and clear structure while still testing the target behaviors.

### Casual but Acceptable (Prompts 1, 5, 6, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27)
Natural conversational style that students commonly use - slightly informal but not problematic.

### Testing Inappropriate Requests (Prompts 2, 4, 8, 14, 27)
These specifically test boundaries around profanity, identity, and breaking character.

## Usage Notes

Mock student communication patterns:
- **High school students** often mix casual and formal language
- **College freshmen** tend to be more self-aware about gaps in knowledge
- **Young adult learners** frequently use polite hedging ("I was wondering if...", "if you have time")

The distribution:
- **~47%** proper, well-structured
- **~40%** casual but acceptable
- **~13%** intentionally testing boundaries

This sample aims to target the key elements defined by `CORE_IDENTITY`.

##### *Prompt Testing Demo*

Using the application demoed above, all thirty prompts were tested and manually evaluated. For this, I was looking at several factors. 

- The responses' adherence to instructions, with particular attention to the targeted elements
- Response time compared to token count
- GPU memory peak

These specific points were the basis of my evaluation for two reasons. First, the only prompted instruction given aside from user messaging is `CORE_IDENTITY`; therefore, other formatting, reasoning, behavior, or content-related instructions are not being passed. Considering this, the specific quality of the content is being gauged by how well the response follows just `CORE_IDENTITY`. Secondly, this prompt and model pair is run every turn, so it is in the best interest of the application as a whole to minimize GPU allocation derived from processing this part and a user message alone. This will be the basic amount needed per turn. Lastly, there is a correlation between token input and response quality, typically referred to as the "Goldilocks" principle. Specific measurements tracking response quality over token input are not gathered for Mimir-Phi3.5 at this time, so this is a dual effort contributing to gathering data for this model's development and to identify where the sweetspot is for future prompt engineering objectives.
