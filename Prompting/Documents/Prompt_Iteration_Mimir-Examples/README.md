# Prompt Iteration
## Overview
Critical to any AI project, prompt iteration is the process of refining prompts through a series of back-and-forth messages with an AI, with interwoven adjustments for improvement. This collection follows the process I developed to iterate on the system prompts, prompt parts used in Mimir, f-string prompt templating, and Jinja message construction. This is intended to be a live document, tracking iterations over time as Mimir is improved.
